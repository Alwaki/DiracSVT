## Setup
The matlab version does not require any additional toolboxes to run. As such it can be run out of the box without any setup.

## Running
Navigate to the main.m file, which is available in the matlab_single_shooting directory. Running this script will perform the shooting method on the given state. The corresponding states can be seen in the included data sheet.
