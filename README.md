## General info
This repository is aimed at solving the dirac equation numerically, using the shooting method. The repository contains three different solvers, written in different coding languages (C++, Matlab, Python) but with almost the same functionality. 
	
## Setup
Each folder contains a separate readme file with instructions for what depdencies are required, and running the code. Note that each version directory is a standalone package, and can be used separately. 

## Details
A file is included which describes a summary of the software, as well as some mathematical motivations and descriptions of the methods applied. This can be found in paper.md.
