## General information

## Dependencies
This version makes use of several python libraries. These can be installed as a batch using pip, following

    pip install scipy pandas numba numpy

Note that it might be necessary to use pip3, depending on your python environment. Moreover other package handlers are also usable, such as anaconda.

## Running

Generally, the only file one should need to interact with to run the code is the main.py file. From here one can change which states to calculate for.
